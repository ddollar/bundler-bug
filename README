/Users/david/.bundle/gems/sequel-3.21.0/lib/sequel/adapters/mysql.rb:6: LoadError: require 'mysql' did not define Mysql::CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS! (Sequel::AdapterNotFound)
  You are probably using the pure ruby mysql.rb driver,
  which Sequel does not support. You need to install
  the C based adapter, and make sure that the mysql.so
  file is loaded instead of the mysql.rb file.
